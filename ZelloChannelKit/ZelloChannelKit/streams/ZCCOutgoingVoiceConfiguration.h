 * channel.
 *
 * @discussion You get access to a <code>ZCCVoiceSink</code> by calling <code>-[ZCCSession startVoiceMessageWithConfiguration:]</code>
 * and passing a <code>ZCCOutgoingVoiceConfiguration</code> object specifying your <code>ZCCVoiceSource</code>. Once the stream
 * has finished being created to the channels server, <code>startProvidingAudio:sampleRate:stream:</code>
 * will be called on your <code>ZCCVoiceSource</code>. Use the provided <code>ZCCVoiceSink</code> to send audio data to the
 * channels server.
 *
 * Once you have a <code>ZCCVoiceSink</code>, call <code>provideAudio:</code> to send audio to the channels server. When you
 * have finished sending your message, call <code>stop</code> to close the outgoing voice stream and invalidate
 * the <code>ZCCVoiceSink</code> object. After calling <code>stop</code>, do not call any further methods on the <code>ZCCVoiceSink</code>.
 *
 * The data is expected to conform to an <code>AudioStreamBasicDescription</code> returned by
 * <code>-[ZCCOutgoingVoiceStream audioStreamDescriptionWithSampleRate:]</code> called with the sample rate
 * passed to your voice source's <code>startProvidingAudio:sampleRate:stream:</code> method.
